# üìÅ **Portfolio Insurance in Systemic Crises ‚Äì A Commodity Market Perspective**
Stata | Quantitative Finance | Time-Series Econometrics

This project explores whether precious metals and diversified commodity indices (TRCC, BCOM) provide reliable portfolio insurance during equity market crises. Using monthly data from 1985‚Äì2025 and focusing on systemic episodes (GFC, COVID-19, Tech-Bubble), it evaluates both na√Øve and mean-variance portfolios through CAPM, quantile regression, rolling beta/correlation, and tail-risk diagnostics.

# üîç Overview of Process
## Data & Motivation:
- We construct portfolios using gold, silver, platinum, TRCC, BCOM, and the S&P500. Motivated by concerns around bond fragility and financialisation, we evaluate whether alternatives reduce downside risk and systemic exposure in crisis regimes.

## Econometric Strategy:
- Core techniques include CAPM regressions with crisis interactions, rolling betas/correlations (12M, 60M, 120M), quantile regressions, and performance metrics (VaR, CvaR, drawdowns, Sharpe, Sortino). Visualisations highlight structural decoupling and time-varying co-movement.

## Literature & Insights:
- Our findings challenge conventional views: while metals offer episodic safe-haven behaviour, diversified indices show stronger equity tethering. Compared with existing studies (Baur & Lucey, 2010; Tang & Xiong, 2012), our evidence underscores the limitations of commodities as standalone insurance.

Institutional investors should consider multi-asset exposure (e.g., REITs, hedge funds, private equity) for more robust risk mitigation.
